I created two Adafruit Huzzah ESP32 Feather models in Fusion360: `Huzzah32 Simple.iges`, which contains the board, USB connector, and ESP chip, and `Adafruit HUZZAH32 ESP32 Feather with Headers.iges`, which also includes the header pins and a JST connector.

You can find the full Fusion 360 project here: https://a360.co/2JaYhVX. 

Measurements based on an import of the [Adafruit HUZZAH32 ESP32 Feather.brd](github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-HUZZAH32-ESP32-Feather-PCB) Eagle Design files and some small amount of manual measurements (using calipers).
