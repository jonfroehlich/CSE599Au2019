# CSE599 Prototyping Interactive Systems
![Example assignments and projects from previous incarnations of this course: CMSC838f at UMD](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/CSE599Sp2019/blob/master/docs/ExampleAssignmentsAndProjects.jpg "Example assignments and projects")
This course explores the materiality and physicality of interactive computing via rapid prototyping. The full syllabus, assignments, and discussions are on our private Canvas site. 

In this repository, we host example code and lecture PDFs (please email me for the raw PowerPoints, which gives you access to animations and the plentiful embedded movies).

## Course Curriculum
This is a new class that will be purposefully experimental. I taught it once before ([Spring 2019](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/CSE599Sp2019)) but will be iterating, adding, and subtracting content as we go--this approach offers freshness and flexibility but at a cost, perhaps, of predictability and polish. For my graduate courses (like this one!), I always try to incorporate new technologies, techniques, and methods--some which are new to meâ€”which means that we will be learning together. :) Optmistically, I plan to cover:

- **Prototyping Interactive Devices**
  - Background and theories about ideation, prototyping, and the science of design
  - When and how to prototype
  - Apply HCI design process to interactive device design from form to function
- **Prototyping Physical Computing Systems**
  - Introduce and learn basics of electronic circuits, including voltage, current, and resistance
  - Introduce and learn basic circuit design concepts, including voltage dividers, pull-up and pull-down resistors
  - Introduce and learn the popular embedded prototyping platform Arduino and programming concepts therein
  - Introduce and learn basic IoT concepts (e.g., connecting to a device, I/O).
  - Introduce and learn basics of electro-mechanical design (i.e., designing for actuation)
- **Prototyping Form**
  - Learn the basics of the 3D-fabrication workflow (measuring, CAD modeling, slicing, printing, iterating)
  - Gain experience building hardware enclosures for an electro-mechanical design
  - Gain experience and basic knowledge of a state-of-the-art CAD tool (Autodesk Fusion 360)
- **Prototyping Machine Learning for HCI (i.e., Applied Machine Learning for HCI)**
  - Introduce and learn basic machine learning approaches popular in HCI/UbiComp, including shape matching and feature-based classification
  - Introduce and learn basic machine learning pipeline: data collection, signal processing, model training, and model testing using k-fold cross validation
  - Introduce and learn popular data analytics tools and toolkits (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, scipy)
  - Introduce and learn popular machine learning toolkits (scikit learn, cloud-based apis)
- **Optimistically: Applied Computer Vision for HCI**
  - I tried to throw this in last year but I couldn't squeeze it in. We'll try again this year. :)
  - Introduce and learn basic image processing and computer vision techniques most relevant to HCI
  - Gain experience using computer vision libraries and basic understandings of CV principles
  - Reinforce ML pipeline previously discussed
