    "# Overview\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook provides you with some basic scaffolding to get you started on the [A3: Gesture Recognizer assignment](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1319205/assignments/5021143). In particular, I wrote some parser code and some initial data structures to parse and load the gesture logs recorded with the [A3: Gesture Recorder](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/CSE599Au2019/tree/master/Assignments/A3-Gesture/GestureRecorder).\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, for this assignment, you will be working with **pre-segmented** data based on how you collected data with the GestureRecorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where to Put Your Log Files\n",
    "You must have your gesture logs in a folder called `GestureLogs` which resides in the same directory as this `.ipynb`. Inside of `GestureLogs`, you should have one or more sub-directories like `JonGestureLogs` or `JesseGestureLogs` that was created by the `GestureRecorder.pde.` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "There are three primary objects:\n",
    "1. At the top level, we have a `GestureSet`, which contains all of the gesture data for a person\n",
    "2. Each `GestureSet` object contains a `dict()` mapping gesture names to trials (recall that in the assignment, you had to collect 5 trials of 11 gestures)\n",
    "3. Each `Trial` object contains the sensor data (`SensorData`) for that trial, which is the accelerometer data (x, y, z, and a computed magnitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there can be multiple loaded gesture sets, we have a global object called `map_gesture_sets` that maps the `GestureSet.name` to the `GestureSet` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your TODOs\n",
    "1. You need to **visualize and explore** the data\n",
    "2. Think about, experiment, and write code for **preprocessing** the data (see **CSE599TODO**)\n",
    "3. Think about, experiment, and write code for **comparing two signals**\n",
    "4. Think about, experiment, and write code infrastructure for **setting up and running experiments** (e.g., k-fold cross validation and confusion matrices)\n",
    "5. Run the experiments and write-up your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Time Warping\n",
    "If you choose to explore Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), I recommend fastdtw. You can install this by typing the following in cell:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "!{sys.executable} -m pip install fastdtw\n",
    "```\n",
    "See https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-jupyter/ for more details"
