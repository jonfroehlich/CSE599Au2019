/*
 * This example demonstrates the importance of debouncing buttons by tracking both
 * raw transitions from LOW to HIGH on the input pin as well as debounced
 * transitions from LOW to HIGH. Without debouncing, you'll observe that
 * the raw number of button presses quickly tracks a large number of transient
 * LOW to HIGH transitions due to the conductive materials vibrating against
 * each other when the button is initially pressed.
